Related to education:

- [Code for Education](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Education-Berlin/)  
  "Code for Education" is a free weekly coworking event to bring teams together working on concrete projects (not just talking) improving the education system. Present your idea, find like minded people to develop your project further or join an existing group of people building education related projects. From software to offline courses, from non profit and open source to for profit - everyone and every education related project is welcome. Let's make education more accessible for everyone!:)

Related to organization

- [Liberating Structures Lab Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Liberating-Structures-Lab-Berlin/)  
  We are a User Group practicing, exploring, and learning how we can use the open-source (and free) 37 group communication/facilitation methods called Liberating Structures.  We use a theme each month, however, it's only there as the container to support our practicing and playing with the structures, which can be combined and used in infinite ways to radically improve how people interact and work together. And you don't need to have any prior experience to join us here!

More technical:
  
- [Berlin-Open-Source](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Source/)  
  Join us for great open source projects, conversations and networking!
  Our goal is to connect open source projects with developers, and developers with projects. Every so often (we try to do monthly, but sometimes that doesn't work out) we get together and hear from various open source projects.
- [Tech for Good Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Tech-for-Good-Meetup/)  
  The idea of proactive, self-empowered, solution seeking citizens, i.e. social entrepreneurs is more than 3 decades old, yet many social and systemic challenges remain unsolved. Indeed, with technology becoming widespread, new and unprecedented challenges arise. We have arrived at a tipping point in history filled with questions and opportunities, when new types of solutions are required. With this Meetup we want to bring together movers and shakers responding to those challenges in exciting ways using technology and those thinking two steps ahead when it comes to the opportunities technology offers to come up with new solutions to those challenges. We are realistic enthusiasts and critical optimists when it comes to the opportunities. Join us on our journey finding the Good in Tech!
- [DTDG: Deep Tech, Do Good](https://www.meetup.com/DTDG-Deep-Tech-Do-Good/)  
  We live in a changing world as the consumer internet is giving rise to a new generation of science-based innovations with the potential to redefine industries, our relationship with the planet and our relationships to each other. The purpose of this MeetUp is to open a space to bring together the DeepTech and Sustainability communities of Berlin and build an Inspiration Bazaar for disciplinary cross-pollination. Whether you are a veteran data scientist, microbiologist, social entrepreneur or impact investor, you are welcome. We will launch Deep Tech, Do Good with a lively discussion with special guests, followed by networking opportunity.
